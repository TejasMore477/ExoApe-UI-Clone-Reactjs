# Exo-Ape UI Clone âœ¨

This project replicates the stunning UI of the Exo-Ape digital agency studio. Itâ€™s not just a cloneâ€”it's a learning milestone! Through this project, I have explored advanced front-end technologies and resolved the notorious 404 'file not found' issue when deploying React applications, making it fully production-ready on Vercel. This application is also containerized and managed by Kubernetes, making it versatile for deployment across various platforms, including Docker-compatible environments.

Try your hand at recreating it or explore it live!

## Tech Stack:
- **ReactJS**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Vercel** (for seamless deployment)
- **React Icons**
- **Locomotive Scroll** (for smooth scrolling and effects)
- **GSAP Animations**

## Containerized Deployment
This project is Dockerized, which means it can be built and run in a containerized environment. Using a multi-stage Dockerfile, the app is optimized for production, allowing it to be easily deployed and run consistently across different systems. You can build and run the container with the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t exoape-ui-clone .
docker run -p 5173:5173 exoape-ui-clone
```

This will make the application accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

Additionally, this application is deployed and managed by Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and high availability across different environments. The Kubernetes deployment configures the app to run in a cluster, allowing it to handle load balancing and automated scaling, thus providing a robust and resilient infrastructure.
