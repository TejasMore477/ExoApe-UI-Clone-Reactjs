 #  Exo-Ape UI Clone âœ¨
 
This project replicates the stunning UI of the Exo-Ape digital agenc Studio. Itâ€™s not just a cloneâ€”it's a learning milestone! Through this project, I have explored advanced front-end technologies and learned to resolve the notorious 404 'file not found' issue when deploying React applications, making it fully production-ready on Vercel.
